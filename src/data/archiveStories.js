        content: `His Excellency, Nana Addo Dankwa Akuffo Addo, President of Ghana, on Tuesday July 5th 2022 cut sod for the commencement of the construction of a 78km single Standard Gauge Western rail line in a beautiful ceremony at Manso in the Mpohor District in the Western Region.

The project will stretch from Manso to Huni Valley and is estimated at a cost of EUR 500 million to be completed within a 42 month period.

The project which is being undertaken by Amandi Investment Ltd includes a construction of railway stations, supply rolling stock as well as workshop equipment. It is also known to be the highest single standard Gauge for rail development in Ghana.

The President in his speech mentioned that, the development of the Western line is on course with the 22km Kojokrom-Manso section progressing steadily and its scheduled to complete before the end of 2022.

H.E Nana Addo, sounded a strong caution to criminals and individuals stealing the rail lines, saying when caught, the law will take its course and the appropriate sanctions would be applied.

The President commended the Railway Ministry, the Board, Management and staff of Ghana Railway Development Authority as well as the Ministry of Finance for finding the needed funds for the project.

Minister for Railway Development, Hon John Peter Amewu, indicated that, rail transportation provides the most appropriate means of haulage of heavy goods such as minerals, timber, cocoa, bauxite, cement and petroleum products which will prevent big trucks from damaging our roads.

Mr Yaw Owusu, CEO of Ghana Railway Development Authority highlighted the benefits that this project will bring to the various communities where the rail line passes. He mentioned that, there will be technology and knowledge transfer as local hired will be trained on how to use specialized equipment.

Currently, Amandi has hired and trained about 700 local persons and is projected to employ more from the surrounding communities. He further mentioned that, about 350 Project Affected Persons (PAPs) have received their compensation out of the 1600 identified, assuring that the rest will fully be compensated for their farms, buildings and lands as determined by the Lands Commission.

Mr Owusu, went on to thank all the various communities in advance for their sacrifices, inconveniences and other nuisance they may have to endure during the construction of the rail line.

The Western Regional Minister, Hon Kwabena Okyere Darko was present and he cited some ongoing rail projects in the western region, indicating that the government would not let the region down.

The Chief of Manso, Nana Katakyere II was present to show his immense support and was enthused about the economic growth the project will come with. He also pleaded with the President to help secure their bad roads as it keeps deteriorating especially in the rainy season.`

        content: `On Tuesday 6th December 2022, His Excellency the President, Nana Addo Dankwah Akufo Addo commissioned the 900m Afienya road over bridge and inspected the Afienya railway station and the 300m Volta Rail Bridge at Senchi all along the Tema-Mpakadan railway project.

The President in his speech described the project as “a brainchild of the first NPP government” from 2001-2009 with the then Minister for Harbour and Railways, Christopher Ameyaw Ekumfi. The President explained that, the project was conceived to create a multi modal transportation network involving road, rail and lake transportation which will help facilitate the haulage of cargo and the movement of passengers from the northern sector to the southern sector of Ghana. He said the project represented another mile stone in the country’s drive to expand and develop its infrastructure.

He further stated that, currently the transportation of domestic and transit freight between Accra, Tema to Nothern Ghana and further to Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger is road based via Kumasi, Tamale, Bolgatanga, Navrongo and Paga has created the over dependency on Ghana’s road network together with the lack of other transport alternatives particularly between Accra and Kumasi has resulted in the congestion, rapid deterioration of road and the increase in road accidents. For this reason, there was a commission by the president for a feasibility study for a multi modal transport link between Tema – Mpakadan and Buipe, through the Volta Lake with the then Ministry of Harbours and Railways in June 2007.

The President further stated that, the feasibility study was successfully completed in 2009, stressing the economic, financial and operational feasibility of the multi modal freight corridor. In October 2016, there was an approval by resolution both by the Credit Facility and the Commercial Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Exim Bank of India, with AFCONS Infrastructure Ltd as the main contractor for the project. He again stated that, the implementation of the project was a testimony of the strong historic ties between Ghana and India.

He said the project would address the imbalance between transport modes for long distance transit and domestic freight movement from Accra, Tema and northwards and vice versa using the Volta Lake transport and enhance safety. He also said, the project, when successfully operational would link the Tema Port to the lake transport network especially the North-South movement over a distance of 400km. It would open the Volta Lake for the transportation of not only fuel and cement but also the container cargo and agricultural produce from the northern enclave in the Afram plains to the port of Tema and other destinations. The project is expected to reduce the pressure on the road network especially on the Eastern corridor which is under vigorous construction. It would also minimize the cost of transportation of bulk commodities, provide affordable and reliable alternative means of transport of passengers who are not served by the road transport along the corridor.

President Akufo Addo was happy with the progress of work on the project and urged the contractors, AFCONS Infrastructure Ltd to complete the outstanding works on schedule. 

The president in his speech concluded that, “I want to put it on record that, in the last five years of my administration, more construction activity in the railway sector has gone on than in any period since independence. We had laid a solid foundation which will receive an even greater impetus by the end of my tenure in 2025. My commitment to the development of a new modern standard railway network is unwavering”.

In attendance of the Commissioning was the Minister for Railways Development, Hon John Peter Amewu, Deputy Minister for Railways, Hon Kwaku Asante-Boateng, Minister Roads and Highways and MP for Atiwa West Constituency, Hon. Kwasi  Amoako Attah, MP for Ningo-Prampram, Hon Sam George, Chief of Afienya Nene Tetteh Afutu Nartey III, Greater Accra Regional Minister Hon. Henry Quartey, India High Commissioner to Ghana, H.E.

        description: 'Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) holds a Stakeholder Workshop',
        image: '/images/archives/arch-3.jpeg',
        content: `The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA), held a Stakeholders Workshop on 15th March 2023.
The purpose of the workshop was to engage various stakeholders of the railway sector on the outcome of the 2020 Railway Master Plan.

The railway master plan is a layout for the development of the railway sector in the country. The first version was delivered in 2013 and has since been reviewed into the current 2020 version.
The Masterplan serve as a guide to the country in constructing its rail network with the aim to link every capital city of the 16 regions and all industrial towns and hubs by the year 2035 to serve as an efficient mode of transport for the movement of goods such as bauxite, manganese, cocoa and to the various ports and processiong hubs as well as transporting passengers to various cities in the country.

The CEO of The Ghana Railway Development Authority, Mr Yaw Owusu mentioned that, an efficient transport system is critical in decentralising the growth of the economy. Although developing the rail sector is capital intensive, it has its long-term benefits to the nation. He further on stated that, we need to make constructing the Railway network a national priority by changing the narrative of our transportation.

The 2013 Railway Master Plan has seen investment made into the sector leading to projects like the;

•	the 97 kilometer Tema-Mpakadan Railway line which is due for completion.
•	the 80 kilometer Railway line from Takoradi to Huni-Valley via Nsuta and Tarkwa.
•	A 6 kilometer double line from Kaase to Adum in Kumasi.

It is hopeful that by 2035 when the Masterplan is implemented, Ghana would have made a remarkable advancement in its rail sector to help relocate commercial activities from already congested urban areas.

The Deputy Minister of Railways Development, Hon Kwaku Asante-Boateng stated that, there is the need to find an alternative means of funding since the cost of constructing the national rail network is huge.

In all, the country requires at about $30billion to build about 4,000 kilometers of rail network across the country.

Stakeholders present at the Workshop were Lands Commission, GRIDCo, Ghana Highway Authority, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, Ministry of Energy, Volta River Authority, Ministry of Railway Development, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Roads and Highways, Environmental Protection Agency, Ghana Ports and Harbour, Forestry Commission, AFCONS Infrastructure Ltd, TEAM Eng, amongst others.

        content: `The government is set to construct 4,000 kilometers of standard gauge railway lines across the country in the foreseeable future per the 2020 Railway Master Plan.

Currently, railway accounts for less than one per cent of the transport sector and the government is poised to make railway a strategic parity and not an auxiliary system to boost inter-modal transport system in the country.

The 2020 Master Plan also provides the roadmap to spur integrated industrial enterprises in Ghana; similar to what is happening in Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Ghana Railway Development Authority, Yaw Owusu disclosed this at a stakeholders’ sensitisation workshop on the new Railway Master Plan held in Takoradi on Thursday.

It was the second of such conferences to be held in three locations across the country. The first one was held in Accra in March this year.

        description: 'DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF GALAMSEY ACTIVITIES ON THE ONGOING TAKORADI PORT TO HUNI VALLEY RAILWAY PROJECT.',
        image: '/images/archives/arch-6.jpeg',
        content: `The government of Ghana, through the Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA), is embarking on a massive railway construction project from Takoradi Port to Nsuta mines through to Huni Valley.

The 80km project, which is being undertaken by Amandi Investment Holdings, is costing the nation €500 million. This project is part of Ghana’s Railway Masterplan and is expected to connect the Eastern line from the Ashanti Region. When completed, it is expected to serve as the primary transportation route for the haulage of manganese, cocoa, bauxite, and for human transport.

However, the activities of illegal miners are posing a serious threat to the project as they excavate and dig very close to the railway lines. If this is not stopped immediately, the devastating effects in the short and long term may include:

Environmental Degradation: The activities of illegal mining involve indiscriminate excavation along the right-of-way, which is causing soil erosion, deforestation, and contamination of water bodies. This can harm the natural environment along the railway route.
Infrastructure Damage: The illegal mining operation is encroaching upon the railway construction area, which can potentially damage rail tracks, bridges, and tunnels. This can pose a risk of subsidence and track misalignment and would result in costly repairs and delays in project completion.
Safety Hazards: The Galamsey activities are creating safety hazards for railway workers. Abandoned mining pits and unsafe mining practices pose risks to anyone near the construction site.
Project Delay: Dealing with the environmental damage caused by Galamsey would require project delays and additional expenses for cleanup and repairs, potentially exceeding the allocated budget and time.
While the Ghana Railway Development Authority is working to combat illegal mining, it’s important to recognize that the activities of illegal miners pose a national security concern and a significant challenge. The Ghana Railway Development Authority alone cannot address this issue, so the government should intervene and engage national security to promptly halt the destruction to safeguard the project.

Thomas Ampem Darko, Ministers of State present, Honourable Members of Parliament Present, Colleague CEO Present, District Chief Executive of Asougyaman District, distinguished invited Guest, Ladies and gentlemen, all protocols observed.

I bring you complements of the seasons from the Management and Staff of Ghana Railway Development Authority as you celebrate this year’s AKWASIDAE  KESE with theme dubbed “Rethinking Akwamu Development- Promoting Peace,Tourism and Education all in Unity”.  We pray to the Good Lord to continue to guide, protect and bring prosperity to Nananom and the good people of Akwamuman.

I will like to commend his Majesty Odeneho Kwafo Akoto III for his exemplary leadership and vision geared towards improving the livelihood of the people of Akwamu. Your dedicated and unfailing support to revamp the Railway Industry in Ghana as a whole is just one example. And the Authority appreciates your commitment and dedication during the construction of the Tema to Mpakadan Railway by creating an enabling environment to ensure that the Contractor, Afcons Infrastructure Limited of India to carry on works without any fear of intimidation or any other backlash.

The Authority also appreciate the support of the Queen mother, Nananom and elders of the Akwamuman for cooperation and support for this all-important national project. Our special thanks also go to the members of the Railway committee formed by Nanamanhene to resolve- grievances between project affected persons and the Contractor.

For the good people of Akwamuman we will like to thank you always for your sacrifice and the inconveniences you may have to endure during the construction of this 97km Railway line.

Nananom,  just to give you a briefing on the status of the Railway Sector. Currently there are 3 major projects under way in Ghana. The three projects are as follows.  The 80 kilometre Takoradi Port to Hunni Valley with a contract price in excess of 500 million euros financed by Deutsche Bank of Germany to support the haulage of Manganese at the Nsuta and as well as the Bauxite mines at Awaso and Nyinahin and to facilitate the activities of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADEC) whose CEO, Mr. Micheal is here with us. The second project is the double line 6 kilometre Kumasi-Adum to Kaase with a price of 48 million financed by the government of Ghana. The contract is David Walter Company Limited, an indigenous local contractor.  The last but not the least is your very  own 97 kilometre Tema to Mpakadan with facilities from the Indian Exim Bank. The Contractor as you all know is Afcons Infrastructure Company Limited of India. By the way, of the three projects mentioned above with a combined contract price in excess of One Billion, the Tema-Mpakadan project is the longest in distance. These three projects also demonstrates His Excellency the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo’s commitment to revamp the defunct Railway Sector moves Ghana one step closer to industrialization.  The President therefore deserves tremendous approbation for making such a courageous move. I would also like to commend the tireless efforts of the Minister of Railway Development, Honourable John Peter Amewu to ensure the successful completion of all three projects.

The Tema- Mpakadan project is currently ninety eight percent (98%) complete and expected to be fully completed before the end of 2023. If not for the global turbulence and other unforseen circumstances, this project which commenced in July, 2018 would have been completed by July, 2023.

Some of the major components of the project which have already been completed include an Operation Control Centre (OCC) at the Tema Port, Maintenance Facility, eight (8) Railway stations at Tema Harbour, Tema industrial Area ,Ashaiman, Afienya, Shai Hills, Doryumu-Kordiabe, Kpong and Juapong.

Also completed is a nine-hundred-metre (900m) Road over Bridge (ROB) at Afienya which was recently commissioned by the President and a three hundred- metre (300) Railway Bridge over the Volta River between Senchi and Old Akrade. The magnificent Railway Bridge over the Volta River is first of its kind in the West African sub-region.

Two (2) Railheads are also being constructed as part of the project; one at the Tema Port which connects to the Cargo Terminals at the Port; and the other one at the Mpakadan Terminal which provides connectivity to the Volta Lake to facilitate the haulage of containerized cargo and other bulk commodities from the Southern sector to the Northern sector and further to our neighboring countries of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.

This is 120km/h Railway line and will connect the Tema Port to a proposed inland Port at Mpakadan. This line is also an opportunity to attract investors to develop industrial and commercial enclave along the Railway line to enhance social- economic transformation of the community and Ghana at large.

Among other benefits to the Akwamu and its surrounding communities, it is our expectation that this railway line will open up the local economy within this traditional Area, create jobs for the youth and improve the tourism industry in your backyard.

 Nananom and elders of Akwamuman,distinguished ladies and gentlemen,   huge Infrastructure project like this is always saddled with land Acquisition issues.  However with your support and cooperation, these issues can be dealt with amicably. If nothing at all, please think about the tremendous benefits to the community to the envy of other parts of the country that may not have such benefits. So far, the lands commission and GRDA have compensated about 600 project affected persons for their lands, crops and structures from Akrade ,  Senchi, Doryumu, Apeguso to Mpakadan. The Lands Commission is yet to submit the valuation report to GRDA for additional Land acquired in these communities. We also expect that all royalties due our Chiefs will be paid in due time.

We want to assure Nananom and the good people of Akwamu that the government made adequate allocation for compensation in this project,and we will disburse the payment as soon as Lands Commission is done with their valuation.

Unfortunately, even though this project is not completed, we have recorded cases of vandalism and theft of the newly installed rail lines and infrastructure. We all agree that this is an asset of great importance to the nation and no amount of CCTV coverage or fence walls can replace the human spirit, vigilance of the eagle-eye and commitment to protect this asset. We urge our communities to own this asset and report any suspicious activities to the nearest law enforcement agency. Solidarity is what is needed to protect this great asset of ours. It’s not about NPP nor NDC but rather about motherland Ghana, which we all cherish.

Once again, on behalf of Management and Staff of the Ghana Railway Development Authority we wish everyone a peaceful and fruitful celebration of this year’s Akwasidae Kese.

As a sign of continuous support to development of Education within this state, GRDA will make to the seed donation to ODENEHO KWAFO AKOTO EDUCATIONAL FUND.

GOD BLESS OUR HOMELAND GHANA, AKWAMUMAN, AND ALL IT’S GOOD PEOPLE.

THANK YOU

        content: `President Akufo-Addo has officially commissioned the 97km Tema-Mpakadan railway line and two new ultra modern trains marking a significant milestone in Ghana’s transportation sector. This transformative infrastructure project is expected to play a vital role in the country’s economic growth and development.

The commissioning ceremony, held on November 22, 2024, was a testament to the determination and perseverance of the Railway sector, which overcame numerous challenges to complete the 97km railway line. One of the major hurdles was acquiring land along the line, which involved demolishing houses, buildings, and structures, and compensating affected individuals.

The successful completion of this project demonstrates Ghana’s commitment to fostering sustainable development and improving the lives of its citizens. With the commencement of train operations, Ghana is poised to experience a significant boost in economic activity, job creation, and social mobility.

According to Mr. Yaw Owusu, Chief Executive Officer of Ghana Railway Development Authority “Our railway lines have been built with a vision for demographic and economic growth. We invite business communities to take advantage of this incredible opportunity by establishing businesses along the rail line.”

This initiative aims to:

Create jobs in communities along the rail line
Foster economic growth and development
Encourage private businesses to partner with us
“As we embark on this new chapter in Ghana’s transportation history, we assure Ghanaians of a safe, comfortable, and efficient ride on our trains. This is an experience to cherish and look forward to.

We also look forward to collaborating with the business community and creating a brighter future for Ghana.”

        content: `As part of the preparations for the operationalisation of Tema-Mpakadan Railway Line and outdooring of the two new Diesel Multiple Engines (DMUs) procured for the line, the Ministry of Railways Development (MoRD) together with its agencies organized a tour for the media. The purpose was to showcase the trains and the recently completed line as well as highlight the ticketing arrangements for the train services.

The tour commenced at the Tema Maintenance Workshop where Dr. Divine Okutu, General Manager of the Tema-Mpakadan Line conducted the media round the facilities. Briefing the press, Dr Okutu highlighted the ancillary structures including the railhead, Operation Control Centre (OCC), train washing areas, refuelling centre, the workshop, amongst others. On board the train, he provided the media with a firsthand look at the train’s features, safety measures, sanitary provisions, indicative train schedules and fares.

From the Maintenance Yard, the various media personnel had a first experience of the train journey through the Tema Harbour Station, Tema Industrial Area Station and terminated at the Ashaiman Station. As well as observing train arrival and departure procedures, media personnel were shown passenger provisions, the waiting areas, washrooms, ticketing arrangements utilising the turnstile gates provided at each station for fare controls.

Discussing the infrastructure and safety challenges confronting the rail operations Mr Al-Amin I. Al-Hassan, Director Policy, Planning, Research, Monitoring and Evaluation (PPRME) of the Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) said, rail components such as bolts, fish plates, etc, are being stolen; installations at station,  point machines, and other trackside equipment and elemental control apparatus for signalling and telecommunication are being vandalised. These pose significant threats to the integrity of the infrastructure and passenger safety during operations. In addition to high operational costs in part replacements, he stated that security of the line is compromised.

Additional concerns to operation safety, according to Mr Al-Hassan, involve encroachment on the Railway Right of Way. Despite efforts by the GRDA and the MoRD at clearly demarcating the boundaries, squatters have encroached on the railway corridor and erected unauthorised structures within proximity to the rail tracks presenting challenges the operational safety and efficiency of the rail line. He appealed to the public to respect the rail line’s Right of Way and to report any incidents of theft or vandalism to the authorities. He emphasized the importance of safeguarding the rail infrastructure to ensure safe and efficient transportation services.

The ticketing system to be adopted for the line was demonstrated by Naa ….. Sales Manager at the MoRD and the app developers. It was explained that the rail service will utilize a modern ‘tap and go’ ticketing system, offering passengers a seamless and hassle-free travel experience. Tickets can be easily purchase both online (through the rail service’s website or mobile app) and at rail stations (at designated ticketing counters). The ‘tap and go’ system allows passengers to simply tap their tickets or smart cards on the reader at the station entrance and exit, making it easy to travel without the need for cash or paper tickets.

Broadly, the media tour was successful at familiarizing the public with the new train service and generating excitement. With the train set to begin operations soon, this tour provided a sneak peek into what passengers can expect from this modern and efficient mode of transportation.

        content: `The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) has raised concerns over the rampant theft of critical rail components by scrap dealers along the Tema-Mpakadan railway line.

In an exclusive interview on Channel One Newsroom on Tuesday, March 18, the Director for Policy, Planning, Research, Monitoring and Evaluation of GRDA, Al-Amin Is-Hak Al-Hassan noted that such behaviour undermines the government’s investment in the railway sector.

According to him, a buffer stop as well as bolts, knots, and element control systems for traffic signals at Tema Harbour have been stolen. He warned that this trend poses a significant risk to rail safety.

He opines that the government spent huge sums of money on building the rail infrastructure, and thus Ghanaians need to take responsibility for protecting and preserving this critical asset.

“Somewhere around Kpong, we have identified a whole buffer stop being taken by scrap dealers. This is dangerous, bolts and knots have been taken, and element control systems for the control of the traffic signal in the Tema Habour are being taken. These are things that we need to provide secure and safe operations.

“If we steal them now, the government has spent $447 million to build the rail infrastructure. Why can’t we patronise this as Ghanaians? Why can’t we show patriotism in what we own?” he questioned.

        content: `The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA), led by its acting CEO, Dr. Fredrick Appoh, conducted an inspection exercise on the Tema-Mpakadan rail line on March 15, 2025, as part of preparations for the operationalization of the line, scheduled for mid-next month. The exercise aimed to ensure the line’s readiness for passenger services from Tema to Adomi Railway station.

The inspection team utilized a utility truck and was accompanied by contractor AFCONS, staff of the Ghana Railway Company, and members of the media, commencing the program at 9:30 am and making several stops along the way. During the exercise, the team identified several concerns, including stolen bolts, trespassing, animal crossings, and pedestrian traffic on the rail line.

The team also observed that thieves had begun removing bolts from the rail line, and Dr. Appoh assured that measures would be put in place to address the issue. The team also engaged with local communities, visiting the bereaved family of a woman who was sadly knocked down by the utility truck at Badiako on 3rd March 2025.

The CEO and management presented the family with a donation of soft drinks, water, and cash, and pledged to mourn with them during the funeral. At Afienya Station, the team encountered a resident digging a drain to connect with the drain constructed for easy flow of water meant to protect the line. The team intervened to address the issue.

The exercise concluded at the Mpakadan rail head, where Dr. Appoh addressed the media, highlighting the President’s vision for a working railway system that operates 24/7, creates jobs for youth, boosts the local economy, and provides safe and convenient transportation.

Dr. Appoh emphasized the importance of community engagement, stating that residents and stakeholders along the right-of-way are being educated on the dangers of walking on the tracks or nearby. He assured that all stakeholders, including chiefs, churches, mosques, and schools, are being engaged to ensure cooperation.

The primary objective of the inspection exercise was to identify potential safety risks and take corrective measures to prevent train accidents and fatalities on the right-of-way. The inspection exercise was documented with photographs, marking the conclusion of the event.

The Tema-Mpakadan rail line is part of a larger project to improve connectivity between Tema Port and the northern regions of Ghana, involving the construction of a 97.6km standard gauge railway line, with six passenger stations and a freight terminal.

        content: `The Director for Policy Planning, Research, Monitoring & Evaluation at Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) Ing. Al-Amin Is-Hak Al-Hassan has called on stakeholders in railway development to sustain efforts towards investment and development of railway infrastructure in Ghana. He was speaking on the progress made in Railway Planning, Construction and Management in Ghana at the Labadi Beach Hotel where he was guest speaker to patrons of the renowned Rotary Club of Accra.

From a brief history of railway construction in Ghana, Ing. Al-Hassan discussed progress made in the development of new Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) lines in the country in accordance with the Ghana Railway Master Plan. The master Plan, he said, is an ambitious national programme to systematically construct 3,844km of SGR to aid national development, and that the SGR is being designed to speeds of 160km/hr, minimum axle loads of 25ton allowing for the transport of bulk cargo, mineral ores and other goods at relatively cheaper costs than other modes of transport.

Lines currently being developed are sections of the Western Railway Line from Takoradi Port through Kojokrom to Manso, Tarkwa and Huni Valley and between Kumasi and Kaasi. On the Eastern Expansion, the 97km Tema to Mpakadan line has been completed. Although current lines appear to be predominantly for freight, he said, passenger and commuter services are integral to the plans. The lines will connect all regional capitals, newly identified areas of mineral deposits and industrial hubs to the national ports. Transnational lines in the Master Plan include the east-west Trans-ECOWAS line from Aflao to Elubo and the south-north Ghana-Burkina Faso Railway Interconnectivity Project (a bilateral project between the governments of Burkina Faso and Ghana) the first phase of which has been completed as the 97km Tema-Mpakadan Railway Line.

The development of railway network is capital intensive and the focus is to initially build freight lines whose returns could be used to subsidise passenger travel as revenue from passenger services is significantly inadequate to pay up the investment. Ing. Al-Hassan bemoaned the inadequate investment in the sector emphasizing that assessment for investment in rail should be based on long-term economic and social benefits as against financial and capital returns.

He discussed challenges posed by galamsey on the Western line. He called on the general public to desist from illegal mining, encroachment, theft, vandalism and activities along the railway corridor that undermine structural integrity of rail infrastructure. Benefits of investment, he said, will not be accrued to the state if individuals steal and vandalise track and rail equipment which the state has spent millions of dollars to construct.

Concluding his discussion, Ing. Al-Hassan announced that the Tema-Mpakadan Line will commence operations for passenger services by mid-year and commuters between Adomi and Tema will be able to access rail services on daily basis.

        content: `The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) wishes to clarify that the industrial action taken by the Ghana Railway Company Limited (GRCL) on Tuesday, May 13, 2025, is entirely unrelated to the GRDA.

The GRDA and the GRCL are separate entities with distinct legal mandates. The GRDA was established under the Railways Act, 2008 (Act 779) to own, develop, maintain and regulate railway infrastructure in Ghana. Since the coming into force of Act 779, the GRCL, a state-owned limited liability company, has focused mainly on operating railway services, including passenger and freight transport.

We wish to assure the public that the GRDA remains fully operational and has not initiated or endorsed any form of public demonstration on any issue. We are, indeed, focused on final preparations for the operationalisation of the newly constructed 97-kilometre Tema-Mpakadan Railway Line, supported by two new trains government has procured.

This milestone reflects GRDA’s continued commitment to fulfilling its infrastructure development mandate and streamlining operational requirements of the new Standard Gauge railway lines we are leading to develop through the Railway Master Plan of Ghana. We reiterate that, there is no disruption to our work, and our operations remain unaffected by any industrial action by the GRCL.

We encourage the public to distinguish between the two institutions and note that the planned strike by the GRCL does not impact the GRDA or our activities. Our staff remain dedicated to advancing key projects and delivering efficient railway infrastructure for national development.

We thank the public for its continued support and understanding.

        content: `The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) deeply regrets to confirm a tragic incident that occurred on Wednesday, 12th November 2025, involving the Tema–Mpakadan passenger service. At approximately 16:15 hours, a young man, believed to be in his early thirties, was fatally struck by the DMU2 train near the Bediako enclave, close to Afienya.

According to preliminary reports, the train operator repeatedly sounded the horn upon sighting the individual on the track; however, the person did not respond or move to safety.

The Community 25 Police Division promptly arrived at the scene and conveyed the body to the Tema General Hospital for examination and formal identification. A full investigation has since been launched by the relevant authorities to establish the circumstances leading to the unfortunate incident.

The Management and staff of GRDA extend their deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of the deceased. We share in their grief and stand with them during this profoundly difficult period.

The GRDA remains firmly committed to ensuring the highest standards of public safety across all operational corridors. Members of the public are strongly advised to refrain from walking along or crossing railway tracks, as these areas are restricted zones and pose grave risks to human life.

We continue to work closely with law enforcement and emergency services to prevent similar tragedies and will provide further updates as investigations progress.

A follow-up meeting was convened on 13th November 2025, during which the Chief Executive Officer of GRDA, Dr. Frederick Appoh, urged the contractors to expedite construction efforts in order to meet the stipulated project timelines. The meeting also served as a platform to address the challenges encountered and to strategize on actionable solutions moving forward.

The GRDA remains committed to ensuring the timely delivery of this critical infrastructure project. Through continued collaboration with stakeholders and proactive resolution of emerging challenges, we are confident that the Western Line will be completed as scheduled—ushering in a new era of efficient, rail-based mineral transport and contributing significantly to national economic growth.

Accra, 12 November 2025 — The Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) strongly condemns two disturbing incidents that occurred yesterday, 11 November 2025.

During regular working hours, one of our trains DMU2 operating near Tema was attacked by individuals who hurled stones at the moving train, endangering both staff, passengers, and infrastructure.

We are working closely with law enforcement agencies to investigate these incidents and bring the perpetrators to justice.

Effective immediately, the GRDA is taking decisive action to protect our operations and personnel. We are issuing a formal directive for all unauthorized occupants and structures along the railway lines to vacate the premises. Eviction processes will begin immediately. This measure is necessary to ensure the safety of our workers, passengers, and the public.
